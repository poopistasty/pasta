Use adequate amount of water and a large vessel to avoid sticking. Wait for the water to boil and then add the pasta. As soon as you place it in water, the starch granules on the pasta swell up and the surface become sticky.To keep pasta from sticking, stir it gently in the beginning. You can also add a pinch of salt. Salt helps in making the surface rough so that it doesn't stick. It is suggested to cook your pasta just a tad more than al dente (bite-like). Avoid rinsing the pasta, after it is cooked. Place it in a colander and let the excess water drain. Rinsing may wash away all the flavour. You can even make pasta from scratch.
